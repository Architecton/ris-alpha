# convert image to grayscale

Histogram equalization improves the contrast.

Thresholding

Find_countorus finds all closed contours on image

for each contour check if not very small and try to fit ellipse.

We are looking for two ellipses with approximately the same center.

Press enter to see ellipses.


It will not always work this well.

instead of doing grayscale and histrogram, you can use canny edge detector. Can also run on already improved image.

Can speed up by cropping

once with get ellipses, filter by centering. If one ellipse is like thih.

If diameter discrepancies are large, not the target.



We know focal distance for kinect in pixels. We can also get te center of ring 




roslaunch view_navigation.launch

detection script on finally on robot computer.

When ring detected, publish marker array

image display depth_registered image raw

it uses mean --- better: use median

ellipse in opencv

e = ((x, y), (dig1, dig2), \theta)

depth image: values correspond to millimeters



get_pose: compute the position of the detected ellipse.
